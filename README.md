## Why i made it ?
I created this project to practice and refine my skills.

## What does it contain? 
This project involves server-side rendering (Thymeleaf) and MySQL for the database.

## How does it work ?
When you log in, you can currently create three things:

+ Goal

+ Routine

+ Achievement

By default, I have a seed service that populates some data for better testing.
This project makes it easy to track your goals, routines, and achievements. You can sort, modify, and even delete them.
For example, this is the page displaying all of your achievements.

## Issues
+ The design is not good and is still in progress.
+ Integration tests will be added.

## Thank you for your time :)
